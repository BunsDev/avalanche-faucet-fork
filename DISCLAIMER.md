## ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ DISCLAIMER ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

The **Playground Faucet** is only for testing purposes of your Avalanche Subnets. Any Subnet Owner can submit a request from the UI to integrate their chain's faucet on this page. This will enable other users to interact with their Subnet by requesting coins from the integrated faucet. Learn more about [Avalanche Subnet Faucet](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/avalanche-subnet-faucet).

**The community updates the content on this page! We are NOT responsible for it, but we can remove them when brought to our notice.**

Since anyone can request to add their faucet configuration, we cannot control what's being displayed on the page. We will try to perform a regular check to identify anything unusual and will remove it immediately. Appropriate checks and rate limiters are in place to prevent users from spamming the website.
